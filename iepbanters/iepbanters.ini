# Short description of the mod, main goals, features etc
Description = The goal of this mod is to ensure that each Bioware NPC gets their fair share of banters with each other. It also intends to expand on friendships and relationships between the various NPCs; the friendship between Mazzy and Aerie, for example, or the peculiar relationship between Jaheira and Viconia. Currently, it adds numerous banters between the Bioware NPCs, humorous, serious or otherwise (SoA, ToB, BGT, BGII:EE, EET).
